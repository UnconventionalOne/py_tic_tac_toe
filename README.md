# py_tic_tac_toe

Single player, text based, Tic Tac Toe in Python 2.7

Original design from: http://code.activestate.com/recipes/578816-the-game-of-tic-tac-toe-in-python/
with ridiculous edits and "AI" implementation by UnconventionalOne.

Currently can only play as 'X' and nothing is logged between games.
Level 1 and level 5 might be considered a little extreme ^_^
